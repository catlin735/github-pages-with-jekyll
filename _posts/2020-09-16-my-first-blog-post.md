User problem: Need to access and extract information from large sets of primary sources to understand trends in historical data.

Users: Historians interested in the particular research niche that my primary source set covers.

Comparison: There are newspaper corpora that allow keyword search of individual ads, but they do not have the features of each ad already collated to analyze in aggregate. There are also already some websites making data publicly available, but that aren't interactive (e.g. CSI Dixie). Databases like Freedom on the Move do the same work, but I would use a different set of primary sources.
